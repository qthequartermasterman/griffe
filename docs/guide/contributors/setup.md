# Environment setup

To work on the project, whether to update the code or the documentation, you will have to setup a development environment.

## Requirements

The only requirement is that you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) installed and available on your command line path.

=== ":simple-python: pip"

    ```bash
    pip install --user uv
    ```

    <div class="result" markdown>

    [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) is the main package installer for Python.
    
    </div>

=== ":simple-pipx: pipx"

    ```bash
    pipx install uv
    ```

    <div class="result" markdown>

    [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/) allows to install and run Python applications in isolated environments.

    </div>

=== ":simple-rye: rye"

    ```bash
    rye install uv
    ```

    <div class="result" markdown>

    [Rye](https://rye.astral.sh/) is an all-in-one solution for Python project management, written in Rust.

    </div>

Optionally, we recommend using [direnv](https://direnv.net/), which will add our `scripts` folder to your path when working on the project, allowing to call our `make` Python script with the usual `make` command.

## Fork and clone

[Fork the repository on GitHub](https://github.com/mkdocstrings/griffe/fork), then clone it locally:

=== "GitHub CLI"

    ```bash
    gh repo clone griffe
    ```

    <div class="result">

    The [`gh` GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) allows you to interact with GitHub on the command line.

    </div>

=== "Git + SSH"

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:your-username/griffe
    ```

    <div class="result">

    See the documentation on GitHub for [Connecting with SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) and for [Cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

    </div>

=== "Git + HTTPS"

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/griffe
    ```

    <div class="result">

    See the documentation on GitHub for [Cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

    </div>

## Install dependencies

First, enter the repository.

If you installed [direnv](https://direnv.net/):

- run `direnv allow`
- run `make setup`

If you didn't install [direnv](https://direnv.net/), just run `./scripts/make setup`.

The setup command will install all the Python dependencies required to work on the project. This command will create a virtual environment in the `.venv` folder, as well as one virtual environment per supported Python version in the `.venvs/3.x` folders. If you cloned the repository on the same file-system as [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)'s cache, everything will be hard linked from the cache, so don't worry about wasting disk space.

## IDE setup

If you work in VSCode, we provide [a command to configure VSCode](commands.md/#vscode) for the project.
