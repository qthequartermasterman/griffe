# Getting started

To get started with Griffe, see [how to install it](installation.md) and [how to use it](introduction.md) with a short introduction. We also provide a [playground](playground.md) if you want to try it directly in your browser without actually installing it.

If you need help, if you have questions, or if you would like to contribute to the project, feel free to reach out to the community! You can open [new discussions on GitHub](https://github.com/mkdocstrings/griffe/discussions), or join our [Gitter channel](https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#mkdocstrings_griffe:gitter.im){ target="_blank" } for a quick chat.
