# Community

Griffe is part of is the [mkdocstrings](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/) ecosystem, and therefore part of the [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) ecosystem too. These two ecosystems have wonderful communities and we invite you to join them :octicons-heart-fill-24:{ .pulse } Make sure to read and follow our [code of conduct](code-of-conduct.md) when engaging with the community.

You can start new discussions on GitHub, in the following repositories, depending on the specificity of the discussion: [griffe](https://github.com/mkdocstrings/griffe), [mkdocstrings-python](https://github.com/mkdocstrings/python), [mkdocstrings](https://github.com/mkdocstrings/mkdocstrings), and [MkDocs](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs).

You can also join our dedicated Gitter channels: [Griffe channel](https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#mkdocstrings_griffe:gitter.im){ target="_blank" }, [mkdocstrings-python channel](https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#mkdocstrings_python:gitter.im){ target="_blank" }, [mkdocstrings channel](https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#mkdocstrings_community:gitter.im){ target="_blank" }, and [MkDocs channel](https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#mkdocs_community:gitter.im){ target="_blank" }. 

The best place to share about Griffe is of course our Gitter channel.

More generally, Griffe is also related to **API documentation** and **API analysis** (static or dynamic): if your project is related to these two domains, but in different ecosystems (other programming languages, static site generators, or environments), feel free to drop us a message! We are always happy to share with other actors in these domains :material-handshake:
